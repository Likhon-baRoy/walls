# Nordic Wallpapers
A collection of wallpapers cherry picked from [reddit](https://reddit.com/r/ImageGoNord), [unsplash](https://unsplash.com/t/wallpapers),
[Christian Chiarulli's discord server](https://discord.gg/Xb9B4Ny), [wallhaven](https://wallhavencc) and
[ThePrimeagen's wallpaper repository](https://github.com/ThePrimeagen/anime).
Most of 'em "norded" through
[ImageGoNord](https://ign.schrodinger-hat.it "ImageGoNord") website from
[SchrÃ¶dinger-Hat](https://github.com/Schrodinger-Hat).

Previews of the wallpapers can be seen in [here](/wallpaper-preview.md).

This one is my favourite :)

## NOTE
This repo is not inactive. I ran out of wallpapers and waiting for pull requests until I find new wallpapersðŸ˜¬ 

## BTW
For Arch Linux User, you can just install these wallpapers via AUR.

```bash
paru -S nordic-wallpapers
```

You can find these wallpapers in `/usr/share/backgrounds/nordic-wallpapers/`.

## Thanks to all the contributors :)
