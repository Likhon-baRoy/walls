## Origin

Just FYI I get most of my wallpapers from [/wg/](http://4chan.org/wg).

## Sorting

I sort things into really general folders, with an `Unsorted` folder for those I haven't gone thru.

## Ownership

Since I got these mostly from /wg/, there's a possibility that some might be legitimately copyrighted. If you see an image that is yours and of limited use, tell me and I will remove it.
